## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light sky blue (#87CEEB). Inspired by the theme of 'upskilling' to evoke a sense of growth, potential, and futuristic learning, sky blue is both calming and forward-looking. This works well with a light theme, offering a fresh and open feel.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F8FF). The background color should be almost white but with a hint of the sky blue to maintain a cohesive look. Its desaturation value keeps the background subtle and clean.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA). An analogous color to sky blue, lavender adds a touch of sophistication and calm, fitting the academy's emphasis on thoughtful growth and development. It stands out subtly against the sky blue and white background, making it effective for highlights and interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. Space Grotesk provides a modern, tech-oriented feel that fits with the academy's upskilling focus, while Inter ensures readability for longer blocks of text.
- Use minimalist icons with a soft glow effect, representing different courses and features. Icons should follow the light, futuristic theme.
- Implement a modular grid layout with glassmorphism cards for content sections. Use particle animations in the hero banner for added visual appeal.
- Subtle animations and transitions using Framer Motion, including hover effects on buttons and smooth page transitions. Use smooth counter animations for statistics in the highlights section.
